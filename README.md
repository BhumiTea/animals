### Various Animals I Like!!
# Mammals
Many pets are mammalian because that is simply the type of animals that we find most favourable. While we can pack bond with anything, It comes out most will other mammalian creatures. My favorite mammalian creatures are the wolf and the elephant. The wolf might be basic but it is the idea of pack bonding with both each other and us makes be have an attachement to them. Elephants are one of my favorites becasue of the empathy they exude and how wise they seem. Both of their young are also the cutest little things I have ever seen.

Technically, birds also probably fall under this category as well. Feathered reptilians and all. Snakes of all varieties have the power to be terrifying but i find them cute mostly. I have debated my thoughts on getting a small snake but I need reciprocation in relationships and to be able to interact with them often. In fact, this is also why I am a bit averse torwards birds. They give a lot of affection and bond strongly, but you can only really pet them on the head safely for reasons that are uncomfortable.
